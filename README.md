## Overview of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that can provide preliminary health diagnoses based on user-provided symptoms. The chatbot will engage with users, gather information about their symptoms, and, through a series of follow-up questions, attempt to identify potential diseases or conditions that might be causing the symptoms. This chatbot aims to be a useful tool for users to gain insights into their health concerns and to prompt them to seek professional medical advice when necessary.

## Data Collection Sources
To build and train the chatbot effectively, I will utilize online available datasets related to medical symptoms, diseases, and their associations. Some potential sources for data collection include:
a.	Disease-Symptom Knowledge Database
b.	Human symptomsâ€“disease network
